## Acknowledgments

This project was part of a Udemy Ultimate React Course by Jonas Schmedtmann code-along (except the new booking feature) that teaches you modern React from beginner to advanced as well as the Context API, React Query, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind, advanced patterns, and more. The new booking feature is my own creation.
